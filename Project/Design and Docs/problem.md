# Problem Statement #
Some people like to cook, however if they are not employed in a restaurant, it can be difficult to share the food they make with others.
Mealer aims to connect cooks and their potential clients through as an application that replicates a restaurant's menus, with available and unavailable meals that can be searched up by clients.

# Scope #
Mealer handles user registration, menu management, search and placement of orders on meals, payment, pick-up information, and feedback on and moderation of the cooks.
It does not, however, handle delivery or communication outside of purchases and feedback
